* Points and vectors


## Key words

* **Points:** A data point
* **Vector:** A line from the origin to a data point
* **Origin:** The n 0's of any dimentional graph
* **Norm:** Using Euclidean distance the norm will be the √ of all of the vectors items.
* **Euclidean Distance:** The "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points
* **Dot Product:** How the vectors are arranged relative to each other


## Points and Vectors

* Data points will be written as [3,2,2]. The coordinates of the plotted data point
* A vector, x. The data points are all of it's coordinates
```
Vector:
     _
    |3|
x = |2|
    |2|
     -
```
* To get the index of a dimension, xi, we write it like this x1 which will = 3 in the above example.
* Adding vector together. The distance between 2 vectors (A, B), distance = (C) will be: A+C = B, C = B-A
* Vector size: Find the vector size using the norm (The √ of all of the vector items)
* Dot product: How the eliments are arranged relative to each other. We can find that by multiplying the relative data points:
```
The dot product (algerbraic):
     _          _        _
    |3|        |3|      |9|
x = |2| *  y = |3|  z = |6|   
    |2|        |4|      |8|
     -          -        -

Geometric version: x*y = |x|(norm) |y|(norm) * cosign (cos) of the angle between them
```
