# Digit recognition (Part 2)


**Your friends now want you to try implementing a neural network to classify MNIST digits.**


Good programmers can use neural nets. Great programmers can make them. This section will guide you through the implementation of a simple neural net with an architecture as shown in the figure below. You will implement the net from scratch (you will probably never do this again, don't worry) so that you later feel confident about using libraries. We provide some skeleton code in neural_nets.py for you to fill in.
