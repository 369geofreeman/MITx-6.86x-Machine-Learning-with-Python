## Introduction Exercise


Which of the following is true about linear regression? Choose all those apply.

Answer = The observed value, 𝑦, is a real number. i.e.  𝑦∈ℝ
Answer = The predictor  𝑓  is a linear function of the feature vectors. i.e.  𝑓(𝑥)=∑𝑑𝑖=1𝜃𝑖𝑥𝑖+𝜃0

**Solution**

By definition, in regression, the observed value  𝑦  is a real number(continuous), unlike  𝑦  is discrete in classification. The predictor  𝑓 , which tries to emulate/predict  𝑦  is defined as  𝑓(𝑥)=∑𝑑𝑖=1𝜃𝑖𝑥𝑖+𝜃0 .
