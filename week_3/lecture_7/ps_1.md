# Problem Set One


## Introduction


### Why Not Regression?


According to the video, which of the following are reasons not to use a regression approach to the ranking prediction problem?

Answer = We might not know all the important features for the prediction
Answer = Usually, users have not ranked enough movies to predict the user's future movie rankings with regression


### Recommender Systems Motivation


Let us assume that we measure the similarity between two users by the rankings that they gave to movies that both of them have already watched. What information will a recommender system (as described in the video) directly use in order to predict the ranking of a user to a specific movie?

Answer = rankings of other users to other movies and to the examined movie
Answer = rankings that the user gave to other movies
