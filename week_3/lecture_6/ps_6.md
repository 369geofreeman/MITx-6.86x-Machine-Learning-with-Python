## The Radial Basis Kernel


### Calculating the Radial Basis Kernel

Recall from the video above that the radial basis kernel  𝐾  is given by

𝐾(𝑥,𝑥′)=𝑒−12||𝑥−𝑥′||2 
 
Let

 	 𝑥 	 =[1,0,0]𝑇 	 	 
 	 𝑥′ 	 =[0,1,0]𝑇. 	 	 
Compute the radial basis kernel  𝐾(𝑥,𝑥′) .


Answer =  𝑒−1


Solution:

𝐾(𝑥,𝑥′)=𝑒−12||𝑥−𝑥′||2=𝑒−12(2)=𝑒−1 .
