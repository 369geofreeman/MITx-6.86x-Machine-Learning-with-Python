## Kernel Composition Rules


### Kernel Composition Rules 1

Recall from the video above that if 𝑓:ℝ𝑑→ℝ and 𝐾(𝑥,𝑥′) is a kernel, so is

𝐾˜(𝑥,𝑥′)=𝑓(𝑥)𝐾(𝑥,𝑥′)𝑓(𝑥′).
 
If there exists 𝜙(𝑥) such that

𝐾(𝑥,𝑥′)=𝜙(𝑥)⋅𝜙(𝑥′),
 
then which of the following 𝜑 gives

𝐾˜(𝑥,𝑥′)=𝜑(𝑥)⋅𝜑(𝑥′)?

Answer =  𝜑(𝑥)=𝑓(𝑥)𝜙(𝑥)

### Kernel Composition Rules 2

Let  𝑥  and  𝑥′  be two vectors of the same dimension. Use the the definition of kernels and the kernel composition rules from the video above to decide which of the following are kernels. (Note that you can use feature vectors  𝜙(𝑥)  that are not polynomial.)
(Choose all those apply. )


Answer =  1 
Answer =  𝑥⋅𝑥′ 
Answer =  1+𝑥⋅𝑥′ 
Answer =  (1+𝑥⋅𝑥′)2 
Answer =  exp(𝑥+𝑥′) , for  𝑥 , 𝑥′∈ℝ
