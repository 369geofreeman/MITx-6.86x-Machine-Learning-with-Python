# Lecture Six


## Nonlinear Classification

**At the end of this lecture, you will be able to**

* derive non-linear classifiers from feature maps

* move from coordinate parameterization to weighting examples

* compute kernel functions induced from feature maps

* use kernel perceptron, kernel linear regression

* understand the properties of kernel functions
