# Homework part 5

#### Let  𝑋  be a continuous random variable with probability density function (pdf)  𝑓𝑋(𝑥) .


# Concept Check

### 1) Is the value of  𝑓𝑋(𝑥)  always  ∈[0,1] ? No

### 2) For  𝑎<𝑏,   ∫𝑏𝑎𝑓𝑋(𝑥)𝑑𝑥∈[0,1]  and represents the probability that the value of  𝑋  falls between  𝑎  and  𝑏 . Yes 


### 3) Is the value of  𝑓𝑋(𝑥)  always non-negative? yes


### 4) The value of integral  ∫∞−∞𝑓𝑋(𝑥)𝑑𝑥  of  𝑓𝑋(𝑥)  from  −∞  to  ∞  is a finite, undetermined value. No
