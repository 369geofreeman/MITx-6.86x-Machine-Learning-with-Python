## Matrices and Vectors

Objectives:

* Recognize the dimensions of the product of two or more matrices.

* Understand the concept of rank of a matrix, and how it relates to the invertibility of an  𝑛×𝑛  matrix.

* (Optional) Understand the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an  𝑛×𝑛  matrix.

## Matrix Vector Product 1

```
         ⎡ 1 2 3 ⎤
Let  𝐀 = ⎢ 4 5 6 ⎥
         ⎣ 1 2 1 ⎦

Let  𝑔 = [ 2 1 3 ]
```

Can we compute  𝑔𝐀 ?


answer = Yes

<hr />

## Matrix Vector Product 2

Let  𝑔  and  𝐀  be as above. Can we compute  𝐀𝑔 ?

Answer = No

## Find the Rank

```
         ⎡ 2 1 0 ⎤
Let  𝐁 = ⎢ 1 4 4 ⎥  Determine the rank of  𝐁 
         ⎣ 5 6 4 ⎦

Recall that the rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or columns.

```

The notion of linear independence and rank is reviewed on the tab after the next one, titled Linear Independence, Subspaces and Dimension.


rank(𝐁) = 2

## Matrix Times its Inverse


Let  𝐌−1  denote the inverse of a matrix  𝐌 . Let  𝐀  be as defined above. Compute  𝐀−1 . What matrix does the product  𝐀𝐀−1  produce?

Answer = Identity matrix
