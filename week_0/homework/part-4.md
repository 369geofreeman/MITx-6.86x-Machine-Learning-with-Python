# Homework part 4

A hyperplane in  𝑛  dimensions is a  𝑛−1  dimensional subspace. For instance, a hyperplane in  2 -dimensional space can be any line in that space and a hyperplane in  3 -dimensional space can be any plane in that space. A hyperplane separates a space into two sides.

In general, a hyperplane in  𝑛 -dimensional space can be written as  𝜃0+𝜃1𝑥1+𝜃2𝑥2+⋯+𝜃𝑛𝑥𝑛=0.  For example, a hyperplane in two dimensions, which is a line, can be expressed as  𝐴𝑥1+𝐵𝑥2+𝐶=0 .


Using this representation of a plane, we can define a plane given an  𝑛 -dimensional vector:  
```
	   ⎡𝜃1⎤
	𝜃= ⎥𝜃2⎥
	   ⎥ ⋮⎥
	   ⎣𝜃n⎦
```
and offset  𝜃0 . This vector and offset combination would define the plane  𝜃0+𝜃1𝑥1+𝜃2𝑥2+⋯+𝜃𝑛𝑥𝑛=0.  One feature of this representation is that the vector  𝜃  is normal to the plane.
