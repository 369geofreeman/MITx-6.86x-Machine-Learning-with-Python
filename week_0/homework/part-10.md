## Determinant


Given a matrix,  𝐀 , we denote its transpose as  𝐀𝑇 . The transpose of a matrix is equivalent to writing its rows as columns, or its columns as rows. Then,  𝐀𝑇𝑖,𝑗=𝐀𝑗,𝑖 .

Recall that the determinant  det(𝐀)  of a square matrix  𝐀  indicates whether it is invertible. For  2×2  matrices, it has the formula

```

 det ⎡ 𝑎 𝑏 ⎤ = 𝑎𝑑−𝑏𝑐.
     ⎣ 𝑐 𝑑 ⎦


For larger matrices, the formula is a bit more complicated.

## Compute the Determinant

```
		⎡ 1 2 3 ⎤
	Let 𝐀 = ⎢ 4 5 6 ⎢
		⎣ 1 2 1 ⎦
```

1) Compute  det(𝐀𝑇) 

	det(𝐀𝑇) = 6

2) Compute  det(𝐀)

	Answer = 6
