### Part 2 - Asymptotics and Trends


For each of the following functions  𝑓(𝑥)  below :

Find its limits  lim𝑥→±∞𝑓(𝑥)  as  𝑥  approachs  ±∞ .

Choose the values of  𝑥  where  𝑓(𝑥)  is differentiable, i.e.  𝑓′(𝑥)  exists

Choose the values of  𝑥  where  𝑓(𝑥)  is also strictly increasing, i.e.  𝑓′(𝑥)>0 .

```
1)

For  𝑓(𝑥)=max(0,𝑥) :

(If the limit diverges to infty, enter inf for  ∞,  and -inf for  −∞  )


lim𝑥→−∞𝑓(𝑥)= 0

lim𝑥→+∞𝑓(𝑥)= inf


Choose the intervals of  𝑥  where

𝑓(𝑥)  differentiable:	 𝑓′(𝑥)>0  :

x < 0			|	 𝑥>0
x = 0			|

2)

For  𝑓(𝑥)=11+𝑒−𝑥 :

(Enter inf for  ∞  and similarly -inf for  −∞  if the limit diverges to infty.)

lim𝑥→+∞𝑓(𝑥)= 1

Choose the intervals of  𝑥  where

𝑓(𝑥)  differentiable:	 𝑓′(𝑥)>0  :

x < 0		| 	x < 0
x = 0		|	x = 0
x > 0 		| 	x > 0
