##  Matrix Multiplication 


```
Let  𝐀 = ⎛ 1 -1 2 ⎞
         ⎝ 0  3 4 ⎠  

and 

         ⎛ -1 0 0 ⎞
let  𝐁 = ⎜  2 0 1 ⎜
         ⎝  0 1 3 ⎠
```

The dimensions of the product  𝐀𝐁  are:

Answer = 2 rows and 3 columns


More generally, let  𝐀  be an  𝑚×𝑛  matrix and  𝐁  be an  𝑛×𝑘  matrix. What is the size of  𝐀𝐁 ?

Answer = m rows and n columns 


In addition, if  𝐂  is a  𝑘×𝑗  matrix, what is the size of  𝐀𝐁𝐂 ?

Answer =

## Vector Inner product


```
Suppose  𝐮 = ⎛ 1 ⎞ and  𝐯 = ⎛ -1 ⎞ 
             ⎝ 3 ⎠          ⎝  1 ⎠ 

The product  𝐮𝑇𝐯  evaluates the inner product (also called the dot product ) of  𝐮  and  𝐯 , which evaluates to

```

Answer 𝐮𝑇𝐯 = 2

The inner product of  𝐮  and  𝐯  is sometimes written as  ⟨𝐮,𝐯⟩

## Vector Outer product 


```
Suppose  𝐮 = ⎛ 1 ⎞ and  𝐯 = ⎛ -1 ⎞ 
             ⎝ 3 ⎠          ⎝  1 ⎠ 

The product  𝐮𝐯𝑇  evaluates the outer product of  𝐮  and  𝐯 , which is a  2×2  matrix in this case.
```

* What is  (𝐮𝐯𝑇)1,1 ? -1

* What is  (𝐮𝐯𝑇)1,2 ?  1

* What is  (𝐮𝐯𝑇)2,1 ? -3

* What is  (𝐮𝐯𝑇)2,2 ?  3
