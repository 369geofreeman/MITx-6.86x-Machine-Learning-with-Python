## Quadratic Polynomials


Recall a degree  𝑛  polynomial in  𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑘  are all linear combinations of monomials in  𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑘 , where monimials in  𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑘  are unordered words using  𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑘  as the letters.

### Examples:

1) A degree 2, also known as quadratic, polynomial in the 1 variable  𝑥  is of the form
```
	𝑎𝑥2+𝑏𝑥+𝑐
```
for some numbers  𝑎,𝑏,𝑐 . The polynomial is determined by the 3 coefficients  𝑎,𝑏,𝑐 , and different choices of  (𝑎,𝑏,𝑐)  result in different polynomials.
In linear algebraic terms, the space of degree 2 polynomials in 1 variable is of dimension 3 since it consists of all linear combinations of 3 linearly independent vectors  𝑥2,𝑥,  and  1 .


2) A degree 2 polynomial in 2 variables  𝑥1,𝑥2  is of the form
```
	𝑎𝑥21+𝑏𝑥22+𝑐𝑥1𝑥2+𝑑𝑥1+𝑒𝑥2+𝑓
```

for some numbers  𝑎,𝑏,𝑐,𝑑,𝑒,𝑓 . Different choices of  (𝑎,𝑏,𝑐,𝑑,𝑒,𝑓)  result in different polynomials.
In linear algebraic terms, the space of degree 2 polynomials in 2 variables is of dimension 6 since it consists of all linear combinations of 6 linearly independent vectors  𝑥21,𝑥22,𝑥1𝑥2,𝑥1,𝑥2,  and  1 .


Consider degree 2 polynomials in 3 variables  𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3 . How many coefficients are needed to completely determine such a polynomial? Equivalently, what is the dimension of the space of polynomials in 3 variables such polynomials?


Number of coefficients needed/ Dimension: 10

What is dimension of the polynomials of degree  𝑁  in  𝐾  variables? (This part of the question is optional and there is no answer box for it.)
