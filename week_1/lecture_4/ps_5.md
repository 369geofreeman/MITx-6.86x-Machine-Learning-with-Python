## The Realizable Case - Quadratic program


### The realizable case 1


In the realizable case, which of the following is true?

Answer =


### The realizable case 2


Remember the objective function

𝐽(𝜃,𝜃0)=1𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛Lossℎ(𝑦(𝑖)(𝜃⋅𝑥(𝑖)+𝜃0))+𝜆2∣∣𝜃∣∣2 
 
In the realizable case, we can always find  (𝜃,𝜃0)  such that the sum of the hinge losses is 0. In this case, what does the objective function  𝐽  reduce to?


Answer =



### Support Vectors


Support vectors refer to points that are exactly on the margin boundary. Which of the following is true? Choose all those apply.

Answer =
