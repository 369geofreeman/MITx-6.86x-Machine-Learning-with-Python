#Â Problem set 2

## Regularization and Generalization


### Generalization 1

If the training loss is low and the validation loss is high, the model might be:

Answer = Overfitting


If the training loss is high and the validation loss is high, the model might be:

Answer = Underfitting


Solution:

If the model is doing very well on the training set but perform poorly on the validation set, it means that it learned features that are very specific for the training set and that are not general enough.
