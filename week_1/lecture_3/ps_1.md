### Review: Distance from a Line to a Point


Consider a line  𝐿  in  ℝ2  given by the equation

𝐿:𝜃⋅𝑥+𝜃0=0 
 
where  𝜃  is a vector normal to the line  𝐿 . Let the point  𝑃  be the endpoint of a vector  𝑥0  (so the coordinates of  𝑃  equal the components of  𝑥0 ).

What is the the shortest distance  𝑑  between the line  𝐿  and the point  𝑃 ? Express  𝑑  in terms of  𝜃,𝜃0,𝑥,𝑥0 .

Answer: d = ∣𝜣∘x₀+𝜣₀∣ /  |∣𝜣∣∣

If there is no offset  𝜃0 , The distance  𝑑  is the projection from  𝑥0  to  𝜃 , which is  ∣𝑥0⋅𝜃∣∣∣𝜃∣∣ (definition of projection). With the offset  𝜃0  added,  𝑑  is  ∣𝑥0⋅𝜃+𝜃0∣∣∣𝜃∣∣ . Thus the distance from a  𝐿:𝜃⋅𝑥+𝜃0=0  to the point  𝑃=𝑥0  is given by  ∣𝜃⋅𝑥0+𝜃0∣∣∣𝜃∣∣ .
