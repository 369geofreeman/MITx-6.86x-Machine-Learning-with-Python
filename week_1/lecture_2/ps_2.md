# Problem Set 2 : Linear Classifiers Mathematically Revisited


## Inner product and Orthogonal vectors

What is the inner product of  [0,1,1]  and  [1,1,1]  ?

Answer = 2 



## Linear Classifier Practice

We saw in the lecture above that for a linear classifier  ℎ ,  ℎ(𝑥;𝜃)=𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝜃⋅𝑥) , i.e. the sign of the dot product of  𝜃  and  𝑥 . Now consider  𝜃  which is given by

𝜃=(1,−1) 
(4.1)
Which of the following points would be classified as positive by  𝜃 ? Please choose all correct answers.


Answer = (1, -1) and (1, 0)




## Offset Added

Again, we have a linear classifier with  𝜃  given by

𝜃=(1,−1) 
(4.2)
and the offset,  𝜃0  given by  𝜃0=−1  Now which of the following points would be classified as positive by  𝜃 ? Please choose all correct answers.


Answer = (1, -1)
