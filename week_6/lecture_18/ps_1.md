# Revisiting MDP Fundamentals


## Review: Markovian Assumption

Which of the following are true about Markov decision processes? (Choose all that apply.)


Answer = The transition probability of reaching a state  𝑠′  from a given state  𝑠  would only depend on  𝑠  and is independent of the states visited before state  𝑠

Answer = The rewards received starting from state  𝑠  would depend only on  𝑠  and are independent of the states that were visited before  𝑠 .



## Policy Function and Value Function


From the following options select one or more statement(s) which are true about the optimal policy function  𝜋∗ , the optimal value function  𝑉∗  and the optimal  𝑄− function  𝑄∗


 𝜋∗(𝑠)  records the action that would lead to the best expected utility starting from the state  𝑠  correct


Answer - 𝑉∗(𝑠)=max𝑎𝑄∗(𝑠,𝑎)  holds for all states  𝑠
