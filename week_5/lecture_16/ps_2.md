# Introduction to Mixture Models


## Gaussian Mixture Model: Definitions

Assume a Gaussian mixture model with  𝐾  Gaussians such that we know all the means and variances. Assume that we also know the mixture weights  𝑝1,…,𝑝𝐾 . Let  𝐱  be an observation obtained from the Gaussian mixture model. Let all of the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model be collectively represented as  𝜃 .

Which of the following are true?


Answer = We should be able to compute the probability density function (likelihood)  𝑝(𝐱|𝜃)  given the information that we know.


Answer = We should be able to compute the probability that  𝐱  belongs to each Gaussian component  𝑗=1,…,𝐾  given the information that we know.
