# Mixture Model - Observed Case



## Observed Case: An Example Problem

Let  𝐾=2  and let  [−1.2 −0.8]𝑇 ,  [−1 −1.2]𝑇 ,  [−0.8 −1]𝑇  be three observed points in cluster 1 and  [1.2 0.8]𝑇 ,  [1 1.2]𝑇 ,  [0.8 1]𝑇  be three observed points in cluster 2.

What are the means of the two clusters?

𝜇1,1= -1

𝜇1,2= -1

𝜇2,1= 1

𝜇2,2= 1
