Answer = Clustering


We would like to predict the expected value of tomorrow's NASDAQ index. Among the following, which machine learning problem is this?


Answer - Regression


## Counting


Consider the following small paragraph that we wish to cluster. We want our clustering algorithm to identify as a cluster text that gives information about a person.

Text: Alice commented on Bob's (a new Software Engineer hire in the team) approach to solving the problem. Alice was quoted in the meeting as saying "Bob's algorithm is theoretically optimal. But, the algorithm is very hard to implement in real time. After all, he does not have an EE background and does not yet understand the way read thresholds work in a memory chip. He needs to come up to speed with what is possible in the read channel. So, set up a meeting with the hardware and chip design engineers." Alice then ended the meeting.

Consider the following “clustering" algorithm: The algorithm assigns as the label to the text the name of the person that appears most in the text.

Does this algorithm achieve our clustering objective?



Answer = No
