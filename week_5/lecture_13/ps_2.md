# Another Clustering Example: Image Quantization



## Clustering in Image Quantization


In the video above, Professor Barzilay described how we can cluster colors into similar groups, and re-color the image with the "representative" colors of each cluster.

As shown in the lecture, the image below is the original image.



On the other hand, the image below is the compressed image after clustering into  𝐾  clusters.



What is the value of  𝐾 , the number of clusters?

Answer 𝑘= 2



## Clustering in Image Quantization


If we use  𝐾=3 , which of the following will be the compressed image?


Answer = A
