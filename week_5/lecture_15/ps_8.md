# Gaussian Generative models


## Gaussian Distribution


Recall that the likelihood of  𝑥  being generated from a multi-dimensional Gaussian with mean  𝜇  and all the components being uncorrelated and having the same standard deviation  𝜎  is:

𝑃(𝑥|𝜇,𝜎2)=1(2𝜋𝜎2)𝑑/2exp(−12𝜎2‖𝑥−𝜇‖2) 
 
Let  𝑥=[1𝜋√2]  be a vector in the two-dimensional space.

Let  𝐺  be a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution with mean  𝜇  and standard deviation  𝜎  taking values as follows

𝜇=[02],𝜎=12𝜋‾‾‾‾√ 
 
Calculate the likelihood  𝑝(𝑥|𝜇,𝜎2)  of  𝑥  being sampled from the Gaussian distribution  𝐺  with mean  𝜇  and variance  𝜎2  taking values as given above.

Enter the value of  log𝑝(𝑥|𝜇,𝜎2)  below. (Note that we use log for the natural logarithm, i.e.  log𝑒() .)


Answer = -1
