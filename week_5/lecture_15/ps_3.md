# Likelihood Function


## Likelihood of the First Model


For simplicity, assume that our vocabulary  𝑊  consists of just two symbols  0  and  1 , i.e.  𝑊={0,1} .

We want to estimate a multinomial model to generate a document  𝐷= " 0101 ".

For this task, we consider two multinomial models  𝑀1  and  𝑀2  with parameters,  𝜃(1)  and  𝜃(2)  respectively. First consider a multinomial model  𝑀1  with parameters  𝜃(1)  given as follows:

𝜃(1)0=12,𝜃(1)1=12 
 
Let the probability of model  𝑀1  generating the document  𝐷  be denoted by  𝑃(𝐷|𝜃(1)) .

Enter the value of  𝑃(𝐷|𝜃(1))  given that  𝜃(1)  takes the values as described above. Enter your answer below as a numerical expression or round it off to four decimal places.


Answer = 0.0625

## Likelihood of the Second Model


Now consider another multinomial model  𝑀2  with different parameters  𝜃2  given as follows:

𝜃(2)0=15,𝜃(2)1=45 
 
The document  𝐷= " 0101 " remains the same as that from the previous problem.

Enter the value of  𝑃(𝐷|𝜃(2))  given that  𝜃(2)  takes the values above. Enter below your answer as a numerical expression or round it off to four decimal places.

Answer = 0.0256


## The best model


Based on your answers for the above two questions, which model between  𝑀1  and  𝑀2  is more likely to generate the document  𝐷 ?

Answer = M1


## Independent Word Generation


Is the language model of each word being generated independently of all other words technically correct in the context of real-world languages like English?


Ansswer = No
