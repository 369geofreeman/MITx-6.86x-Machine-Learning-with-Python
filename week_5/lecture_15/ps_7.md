# Prior, Posterior and Likelihood



## Prior, Posterior and Likelihood

Consider a binary classification task with two labels '+' (positive) and '-' (negative).

Let  𝑦  denote the classification label assigned to a document  𝐷  by a multinomial generative model  𝑀  with parameters  𝜃+  for the positive class and  𝜃−  for the negative class.

Which of the following option(s) is/are true about the prior, posterior or likelihood distributions for this classifier? Choose the correct notations from the statements below:


Answer = 𝑃(𝑦=+|𝐷)  is the posterior distribution

Answer = 𝑃(𝑦=+)  is the prior distribution



## A Numerical Example

Let's say that the prior for the positive class takes the following value:

𝑃(𝑦=+)=0.3 
 
Also, say that  𝑃(𝐷|𝜃+)=.3  and  𝑃(𝐷|𝜃−)=.6 

From the above values of prior and likelihood, calculate the value of  𝑃(𝐷) , the probability of generating document  𝐷 . Enter the value below:

Answer = 0.51


From  𝑃(𝐷)  also estimate the posterior probability  𝑃(𝑦=+|𝐷) . Enter your answer as a numerical expression or round it off to two decimal places.

Answer = 0.18
