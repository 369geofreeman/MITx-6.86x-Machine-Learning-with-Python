## Simple Multinomial Generative model


Consider a very simple multinomial model  𝑀  to generate text in documents.

Let us assume that this model  𝑀  has a fixed vocabulary  𝑊  and that we generate a document by sampling one word at a time from this vocabulary. Furthermore, all the words that are generated by  𝑀  are independent of each other.

We would like to capture the fact in our generative model  𝑀  that some words in  𝑊  are more likely to occur in any given document than the others. So, the first thing that  𝑀  models is how likely it is to generate certain word  𝑤∈𝑊 . We denote this probability by  𝑃(𝑤|𝜃)=𝜃𝑤 , where  𝜃𝑤  is a parameter in our model  𝑀 .

Which of the following option(s) is/are true about the model parameters  𝜃𝑤 ? Choose all that apply from the statements below:


Answer = 𝜃𝑤≥0

Answer = ∑𝑤∈𝑊𝜃𝑤=1
