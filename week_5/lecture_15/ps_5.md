#  MLE for Multinomial Distribution


## Deriving MLE for a General Multinomial Model: Likelihood


In the following problems, we will derive the maximum likelihood estimates for a multinomial model with more than 2 parameters. We will employ the method of lagrange multipliers for the optimization problem.

Let the document  𝐷  be a sequence of words  𝑤1,…,𝑤𝑛  from a collection  𝑊  consisting of  𝑁  words. For simplicity, we assume that  𝑤𝑖 's are independent, and that the probability of a word  𝑤  is given by the parameter  𝜃𝑤 , and denote by  𝜃={𝜃𝑤}𝑤∈𝑊 .

Let  𝑃(𝐷|𝜃)  be the probability of  𝐷  being generated by the simple model described above.

Find  𝑃(𝐷|𝜃) .

Answer = 


## Constraints on the Parameters


What are the constraints on the parameters  𝜃𝑤  in the model described in the previous problem?

## Stationary Points of the Lagrange Function


The maximum likelihood estimate of  𝜃  is the value of  𝜃  that maximizes the likelihood function:

𝑃(𝐷|𝜃)=∏𝑤∈𝑊(𝜃𝑤)count(𝑤). 
 
Maximizing  𝑃(𝐷|𝜃)  is equivalent to maximizing  log𝑃(𝐷|𝜃) , so we take the natural logarithm on both sides of the equation above to bring down the exponents:

log𝑃(𝐷|𝜃)=∑𝑤∈𝑊count(𝑤)log𝜃𝑤. 
 
Recall that  𝜃  is subject to the following constraint:

∑𝑤∈𝑊𝜃𝑤=1. 
 
To maximize  log𝑃(𝐷|𝜃)  subject to the contraint  ∑𝑤∈𝑊𝜃𝑤=1,  we use the Lagrange multiplier method.


Define the Lagrange function:

𝐿=log𝑃(𝐷|𝜃)+𝜆(∑𝑤∈𝑊𝜃𝑤−1) 
 
where  𝜆  is a constant scalar.

Then, find the stationary points of  𝐿  by solving the equation  ∇𝜃𝐿=0 . The components of this equation are

∂∂𝜃𝑤(log𝑃(𝐷|𝜃)+𝜆(∑𝑤∈𝑊𝜃𝑤−1))=0for all 𝑤∈𝑊. 
 
Solve for  𝜃𝑤  from the above equation. Choose the right answer for  𝜃𝑤  from options below.


Answer = 


Now, apply the constraint that  ∑𝑤∈𝑊𝜃𝑤=1  to the answer above to obtain  𝜆 .
